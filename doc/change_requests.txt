------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Once software is placed in a controlled baseline, all changes are tracked. A
distinction must be made for the cause of a change. The change categories are:

Type 0: Critical failures, which are defects that are nearly always fixed 
before any external release. In general, these sorts of changes represent 
showstoppers that have an impact on the usability of the software in its
critical use cases.
 
Type 1: A bug or defect that either does not impair the usefulness of the 
system or can be worked around. Such errors tend to correlate with nuisances
in critical use cases or serious defects in secondary use cases that have a 
low probability of occurrence.

Type 2: A change that is an enhancement rather than a response to a defect.
Its purpose is typically to improve performance, testability, usability, or
some other aspect of quality that represents good value engineering.

Type 3: A change that is necessitated by an update to the requirements. This 
could be new features or capabilities that are outside the scope of the 
current vision and business case.

Type 4: Changes that are not accommodated by the other categories.
